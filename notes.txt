 > qt - Missing
   >> Didn't find: Qt (version 4 or 5); install it from packages, or download from https://info.qt.io/download-qt-for-application-development
   >> Try: "sudo apt-get install qt5-dev-tools libqt5-dev", if you have sudo rights.

Didn't work, package name is qt5-default (maybe installs too much, even)

************************************
 > setuptools - Missing
   >> The python-setuptools package is not installed, try to install it.
   >> Try: "sudo apt-get install python-setuptools", if you have sudo rights.

Installing python-setuptools doesn't remove the warning
python-setuptools is already the newest version (39.0.1-2).

Installing python3-setuptools doesn't remove the warning
python3-setuptools is already the newest version (39.0.1-2).

"pip install -U setuptools" fixes the problem. No idea of the difference w.r.t. the packaged version

**************************************
This is the list of things I did install:
    3  apt install mercurial
    5  apt install git
    7  apt install libclang-dev
    8  apt install python-setuptools
    9  apt install g++
   10  apt install libxml2-dev
   11  apt install python-dev
   17  apt install qt5-default
   19  apt install python3-setuptools
   35  apt install python-pip
   36  apt install python3-pip
   38  pip install -U setuptools

**************************************

Did not bother about missing pygoocanvas and pygraphviz

In the source directory there are two pygccxml directories:
- pygccxml
- pygccxml-1.9.1

WHY ?
They seems to be identical.

$ diff -r pygccxml pygccxml-1.9.1/
Only in pygccxml: .git

************************************** Build phase
 >> Building nsc-dev - Problem
 > Problem: Optional dependency, module "nsc-dev" failed

Does not say what's wrong, and bake show didn't warn about issues.

 >> Building click-dev - Problem
   >> Unavailable building tool for module click-dev, install autotools

Why bake show didn't say it before ?

 >> Building castxml - Problem
   >> Unavailable building tool for module castxml, install cmake

Same as before, cmake wasn't listed in bake show

 # apt install cmake automake autoconf

***************************************

pecos@pecos-VirtualBox:~/workspace/bake$ ./bake.py build
 >> Building nsc-dev - Problem
 > Problem: Optional dependency, module "nsc-dev" failed
   This may reduce the  functionality of the final build.
   However, bake will continue since "nsc-dev" is not an essential dependency.
   For more information call bake with -v or -vvv, for full verbose mode.

 >> Building BRITE - OK
 >> Building click-dev - OK
 >> Building netanim - OK
 >> Building openflow-dev - OK
 >> Building castxml - Problem
 > Problem: Optional dependency, module "castxml" failed
   This may reduce the  functionality of the final build.
   However, bake will continue since "castxml" is not an essential dependency.
   For more information call bake with -v or -vvv, for full verbose mode.

The error (-vvv) seems to be:

pecos@pecos-VirtualBox:~/workspace/bake$ ./bake.py build -vvv -o castxml

Note that:

pecos@pecos-VirtualBox:~/workspace/bake$ dpkg -l | grep llvm
ii  libllvm6.0:amd64                           1:6.0-1ubuntu2                      amd64        Modular compiler and toolchain technologies, runtime library

Nevertheless...

  apt install llvm

This does the trick. Castxml seems to be happy.
As a side note, "bake.py build" doesn't seems to use incremental builds... why ?


Now the final test...

pecos@pecos-VirtualBox:~/workspace/bake/source/ns-3-dev$ ./waf --apiscan=sixlowpan --no32bit-scan
Waf: Entering directory `/home/pecos/workspace/bake/source/ns-3-dev/build'

Checking waf config confirms that apiscan is not enabled.
Moreover... python-config is not found (but launching from the terminal works).
